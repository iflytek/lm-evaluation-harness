Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374

This is an evaluation harness for the HumanEval problem solving 
dataset described in the paper "Evaluating Large Language Models 
Trained on Code". It used to measure functional correctness for 
synthesizing programs from docstrings. It consists of 164 original 
programming problems, assessing language comprehension, algorithms, 
and simple mathematics, with some comparable to simple software 
interview questions.
